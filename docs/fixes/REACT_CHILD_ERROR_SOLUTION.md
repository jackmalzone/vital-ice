# React Child Error Solution - Map Component Cleanup

## Problem

**Error:** `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {children})`

This error was occurring when the Footer component was rendered, specifically when trying to use a custom Map component that was attempting to render objects instead of valid JSX.

## Root Cause

The error was caused by:

1. **Lingering Map component files** - Even after removing imports, the `Map.tsx` and `Map.module.css` files remained in the codebase
2. **Complex Map implementation** - The Map component was trying to handle TomTom API integration with complex state management
3. **Object rendering** - The Map component was likely returning objects instead of valid JSX elements

## Solution

### 1. **Removed Complex Map Component**

- Deleted `src/components/ui/Map/Map.tsx`
- Deleted `src/components/ui/Map/Map.module.css`
- Eliminated all TomTom API integration attempts

### 2. **Simplified Footer Address Implementation**

- Replaced complex Map component with simple Google Maps link
- Address now opens Google Maps in new tab
- Maintained hover effects and accessibility

### 3. **Updated Footer Component**

**Before (Problematic):**

```tsx
import Map from '@/components/ui/Map/Map';

const Footer: FC = () => {
  const [isMapVisible, setIsMapVisible] = useState(false);
  const TOMTOM_API_KEY = '8ZhtU50butopO60Y99hozgeecYT2CU1C';

  const handleAddressHover = (show: boolean) => {
    if (show) {
      setTimeout(() => setIsMapVisible(true), 300);
    } else {
      setIsMapVisible(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <address onMouseEnter={() => handleAddressHover(true)}>
      {isMapVisible && <Map address={address} apiKey={TOMTOM_API_KEY} />}
    </address>
  );
};
```

**After (Fixed):**

```tsx
const Footer: FC = () => {
  const address = '2400 Chestnut St, San Francisco, CA 94123';
  const googleMapsUrl = `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=${encodeURIComponent(address)}`;

  return (
    <a
      href={googleMapsUrl}
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      className={styles.footer__address}
      aria-label={`Open ${address} in Google Maps`}
    >
      <address>
        2400 Chestnut St
        <br />
        San Francisco, CA 94123
      </address>
    </a>
  );
};
```

### 4. **Updated CSS**

**Added focus styles to remove blue border:**

```css
.footer__address:focus {
  outline: none;
}

.footer__address:focus-visible {
  outline: none;
}
```

## Benefits of the Solution

### ✅ **Reliability**

- No complex API integrations
- No external dependencies
- No React child errors

### ✅ **User Experience**

- Familiar Google Maps interface
- All Google Maps features available (directions, street view, etc.)
- Fast loading - no API calls

### ✅ **Accessibility**

- Proper ARIA labels
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support

### ✅ **Performance**

- No additional JavaScript bundles
- No API rate limits
- No loading states

### ✅ **Maintenance**

- Simple implementation
- No API key management
- No version compatibility issues

## Testing Process

### 1. **Isolated the Problem**

- Commented out all components except `<Hero />`
- Error was gone, confirming Hero was not the issue
- Uncommented components one by one
- Error returned when `<Footer />` was uncommented

### 2. **Identified the Culprit**

- Found lingering Map component files
- Removed all Map-related code
- Simplified to Google Maps link

### 3. **Verified the Fix**

- Footer renders without errors
- Address link works correctly
- Hover effects function properly

## Prevention

### **Best Practices for Future Map Implementations:**

1. **Use Simple Links First**

   - Start with Google Maps links
   - Only add custom maps if absolutely necessary

2. **Avoid Complex API Integrations**

   - External map APIs can be unreliable
   - Browser compatibility issues
   - API key management overhead

3. **Test Incrementally**

   - Add components one at a time
   - Test thoroughly before adding complexity

4. **Keep Dependencies Minimal**
   - Prefer native browser features
   - Use established services (Google Maps)
   - Avoid custom implementations when possible

## Notes

- The TomTom API key `8ZhtU50butopO60Y99hozgeecYT2CU1C` was removed from the codebase
- All Map component references were eliminated
- The solution is more user-friendly than a custom map component
- Google Maps provides better functionality and reliability
