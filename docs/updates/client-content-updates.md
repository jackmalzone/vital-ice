### About Us

#### Explanation of Our Story

> Behind the name, we're just three local enthusiasts who wanted something simple: a place to cold plunge with our friends, close to home. When we couldn't find anything that felt right—affordable, high-quality, and built around community—we decided to create it ourselves. Vital Ice was built to bridge the gap between high-performance recovery and everyday accessibility.

> This started as a personal need and turned into something bigger: a space where people can reset, recover, and connect. No pressure. No BS. Just cold water, hot air, and the pride that comes with prioritizing your health and wellness.

> We built this for the early risers, the post-work plungers, the weekend warriors, and anyone trying to take care of their body and mind in a way that feels real. Whether you're here to get centered, recover from a hard workout, or just share a moment of peace—we're glad you're here.

> Recovery isnt a luxury — it's a ritual.
> — The Vital Ice Team

#### Meet the Founders

##### Stephen

> I am an Irish immigrant and a hairstylist by trade, and I've always loved helping people feel better — whether thats through a great haircut or simply offering small moments of calm in the midst of busy lives. Fitness has been part of my life from a young age, but as I got older I realized that recovery matters just as much.

> Vital Ice started because I needed it myself. Life gets a little chaotic sometimes, and contrast therapy became my way to slow things down, clear my head, and hit the reset button. I never imagined it would grow into this — a space where people come together to feel better.

> My personal goal is to create a space where recovery feels accessible, ritual— and shared by the community

##### Sean

> I'm a Chicago native, born and raised. At 16, my family relocated to Ireland, where I completed my degree in Electrical Engineering. My journey ultimately brought me to San Francisco, where I now work in business development within the physical security industry.

> My passion for health and wellness is deeply tied to how I spend my free time. In Ireland, I discovered Gaelic Football and went on to compete at the highest level before returning to the States. Today, I still play in the local league here in SF. Sport inspired me to relentlessly pursue the optimization of my health. Contrast therapy—especially cold exposure—has long been a cornerstone of recovery for elite athletes around the world. I have consistently relied on it to stay strong and healthy.

> In a world full of toxins and distractions, I believe more than ever in the importance of accessible recovery—and meaningful connection. We thrive when we feel good, and even more so when we do it together. I hope Vital Ice creates that space and makes a lasting, positive impact on everyone who walks through our doors.

##### Barry

> Barry is a proud Irish immigrant, lifelong athlete, secretary of a local Gaelic football team and the founder & operator of a successful general contracting business here in the Bay Area. A husband, a father, and a tireless worker, Barry brings a rare mix of grit, heart, and craftsmanship to everything he does.

> His passion for sports and physical performance has shaped much of his life, and that same drive shows up in his work ethic today. As someone who understands the demands of building—both physically and professionally—hesa firm believer in the power of recovery and routine.

> Barry is the force behind the construction of the Vital Ice studio. His hands-on involvement ensures every inch of the space reflects intention, durability, and care. He's building more than walls—hes helping shape a space that gives back to the body, the mind, and the community.

### Benefits Expanded

#### Cold Plunge

> An ancient practice, reimagined for modern recovery. Historic traditions from Nordic cultures and Japanese onsen, cold water immersion has been used for centuries to promote resilience, healing, and longevity. Cold plunging involves submerging the body in water typically between39d 55°F for a short duration (1–10 minutes at a time). The cold stimulates the nervous system, constricts blood vessels, and triggers a powerful physiological and physiological responses.

**Scientific Benefits:**

- **Nervous System Regulation:** Cold exposure activates the sympathetic nervous system, then supports a rebound into the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) state — helping to build resilience to stress and improve emotional regulation.
- **Muscle Recovery:** Vasoconstriction reduces inflammation, muscle soreness, and swelling. When followed by re-warming, it improves circulation and speeds up recovery after intense training.
- **Improved Circulation:** Cold exposure stimulates blood flow by forcing the cardiovascular system to adapt — strengthening blood vessels and improving oxygen delivery throughout the body.
- **Metabolic & Hormonal Effects:** May support brown fat activation, improved insulin sensitivity, and modest boosts in dopamine and norepinephrine, enhancing mood, focus, and energy.
- **Mental Clarity & Resilience:** Short-term cold stress has been shown to elevate mood and sharpen focus by increasing norepinephrine up to 5x baseline. Regular exposure builds mental toughness and stress adaptation.

#### Infrared Sauna

> Infrared saunas introduce a modern, evidence-based approach to the ancient heat ritual. Unlike traditional saunas, which heat the air around you, infrared saunas use specific wavelengths of light, typically in the far-infrared range to warm the body directly. This allows for a deep, penetrating heat that stimulates the body at lower ambient temperatures (typically 120150ing the experience more accessible and less taxing on the cardiovascular system.

> The infrared light penetrates up to 1.5inches beneath the skin, triggering a thermal effect at the cellular level. This response can support:

- Increased circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues
- Reduced inflammation and muscle soreness
- Improved detoxification by stimulating perspiration
- Accelerated recovery and tissue repair
- Stress relief via parasympathetic nervous system activation

> Research suggests that consistent use may also support cardiovascular health, skin clarity, and overall metabolic function.

> As a newer recovery technology, infrared saunas provide a lower-barrier entry point for those looking to incorporate heat therapy into their wellness routine — making it an ideal complement to cold plunge contrast therapy.

#### Traditional Sauna

> Rooted in centuries of Nordic tradition, the traditional sauna is a centuries old method of recovery and revitalization. Heated between 160and 200F, it uses dry air and radiant heat to create a full-body sweat experience that promotes deep relaxation and physiological reset.

> Unlike infrared saunas, which heat the body directly, traditional saunas warm the surrounding air, raising your core temperature, increasing circulation, and stimulating a powerful sweat response. This natural process supports:

- Muscle recovery and inflammation reduction
- Detoxification through elevated perspiration
- Cardiovascular stimulation, mimicking the effects of light aerobic exercise
- Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system for stress relief and mental clarity

> Long-term sauna use has been associated with improved heart health, cognitive function, and overall wellbeing, backed by decades of research — especially from Finland, where sauna culture remains a daily ritual.

#### General Comment on Core Services

> Hormones play a crucial role in men's and women's health — influencing growth, energy, mood, metabolism, and overall vitality. While levels naturally decline with age, certain lifestyle practices can help support and even increase healthy hormone production.

> At Vital Ice, our cold and heat therapies offer a foundational solution to hormonal optimization.

#### Red Light Therapy

> Red Light Therapy, scientifically known as photobiomodulation, is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light to stimulate cellular function and support tissue repair. Unlike ultraviolet light, which can damage the skin, red and infrared light penetrate safely beneath the surface — reaching muscles, joints, and even mitochondria (your cells energy engine). Our IR Saunas are equipped with Red light bulbs, we also offer Red Light Therapy Masks.

**How It Works:**

- Wavelengths used: Typically 630nanometers
- Light penetrates 1–2s into soft tissue
- It stimulates cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria, enhancing ATP (energy) production
- This boosts cellular performance, repair, and regeneration

**Science-Backed Benefits:**

- Reduced inflammation
- Accelerated muscle recovery
- Improved skin tone, collagen production, and wound healing
- Enhanced circulation and oxygen delivery
- Pain relief (especially joint, tendon, and back pain)
- Potential support for testosterone regulation (when targeted appropriately)

**Neurological & Mood Benefits:**
Emerging research also shows promise for:

- Supporting cognitive function and brain health
- Reducing symptoms of anxiety or seasonal depression by influencing neurotransmitters and brain blood flow

**Hair Growth**

> Red Light Therapy is painless, drug-free, and requires no downtime — making it a powerful addition to any recovery or performance routine. At Vital Ice, we offer it as part of a complete system to help you reset, repair, and recharge from the inside out.

#### Compression Therapy

> A performance recovery tool trusted by elite athletes and physical therapists, compression therapy uses dynamic pneumatic pressure to support circulation, reduce soreness, and accelerate recovery. Specialized sleeves are worn on the legs or arms, where sequential compression mimics the body's natural muscle pump — helping to move blood, lymph, and metabolic waste efficiently.

> Sessions typically last15 minutes and offer a passive yet powerful recovery experience, promoting fresh oxygen delivery to tired tissues while reducing inflammation and heaviness.

**Scientific Benefits:**

- **Circulatory Support:** Sequential compression enhances venous return and stimulates blood flow, which helps deliver nutrients and oxygen to muscle tissue while removing waste byproducts like lactic acid.
- **Reduced Swelling & Inflammation:** By promoting lymphatic drainage and reducing fluid buildup, compression therapy can ease swelling and inflammation caused by intense training, long periods of standing, or injury.
- **Muscle Recovery & Soreness Relief:** Helps decrease delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and promotes faster muscle repair by increasing circulation and reducing stagnation in fatigued limbs.
- **Enhanced Lymphatic Function:** Supports healthy lymphatic flow, aiding the body's detoxification processes and immune response — especially beneficial after travel, illness, or physical stress.
- **Relaxation & Mobility:** The rhythmic compression can help release tension in the lower body, reduce the sensation of heaviness or fatigue, and improve mobility and range of motion.

> Compression therapy is an ideal complement to cold and heat exposure therapy — offering a low-effort, high-impact way to round out your recovery routine.

#### Percussion Therapy

> Targeted relief, deep muscle activation. Percussion therapy uses rapid, high-frequency pulses from a handheld massage device to reach deep into muscle tissue. This technique helps break up adhesions, reduce soreness, stimulate circulation, and promote faster recovery — all in just a few minutes.

> Whether you're prepping for movement or winding down from a workout, percussion therapy can be tailored to your needs: activating underused muscles, easing tight spots, or simply helping your body feel more fluid and balanced.

**Scientific Benefits:**

- **Increased Circulation:** Percussive pulses stimulate blood flow and deliver oxygen-rich nutrients to muscle tissue, aiding repair and reducing recovery time.
- **Soreness & Tension Relief:** Breaks up knots and adhesions, alleviates muscle tightness, and decreases delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after physical activity.
- **Improved Range of Motion:** Loosens stiff muscle groups and fascia, improving flexibility and mobility — especially beneficial pre-workout or after long periods of sitting.
- **Neuromuscular Activation:** Helps wake up sluggish muscles and reset neuromuscular pathways, making it an effective warm-up tool for both training and daily movement.
- **Stress Reduction:** The rhythmic vibration has calming effects on the nervous system, supporting relaxation and reducing physical stress held in the body.

> Used intentionally, percussion therapy is a fast, focused way to tune up your body and help you move — and feel — better every day.
