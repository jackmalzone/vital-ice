                In consideration for being allowed to use the services and facilities of Vital Ice,
                I hereby release, waive, and discharge Vital Ice, its owners, staff, contractors,
                and affiliates from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, or causes of action,

                I expressly waive any rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which
                states: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or
                releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
                executing the release, and that, if known by him or her, would have materially
                affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.&quot;

                information.

              <h3>MEDIA RELEASE (OPTIONAL)</h3>
              <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                Unless I notify staff in writing, I grant permission for Vital Ice to use any photos
                or video taken during my participation for promotional or marketing purposes.
              </p>

              <h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND CONSENT</h3>
