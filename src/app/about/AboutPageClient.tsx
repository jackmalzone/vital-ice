Fitness has been part of my life from a young age, but as I got older I realized that recovery matters just as much.\n\nVital Ice started because I needed it myself. Life gets a little chaotic sometimes, and contrast therapy became my way to slow things down, clear my head, and hit the reset button. I never imagined it would grow into this — a space where people come together to feel better.\n\nMy personal goal is to create a space where recovery feels accessible, ritual— and shared by the community",

My journey ultimately brought me to San Francisco, where I now work in business development within the physical security industry.\n\nMy passion for health and wellness is deeply tied to how I spend my free time. In Ireland, I discovered Gaelic Football and went on to compete at the highest level before returning to the States. Today, I still play in the local league here in SF. Sport inspired me to relentlessly pursue the optimization of my health. Contrast therapy—especially cold exposure—has long been a cornerstone of recovery for elite athletes around the world. I have consistently relied on it to stay strong and healthy.\n\nIn a world full of toxins and distractions, I believe more than ever in the importance of accessible recovery—and meaningful connection. We thrive when we feel good, and even more so when we do it together. I hope Vital Ice creates that space and makes a lasting, positive impact on everyone who walks through our doors.",

                  Behind the name, we&apos;re just three local enthusiasts who wanted something
                  simple: a place to cold plunge with our friends, close to home. When we
                  couldn&apos;t find anything that felt right—affordable, high-quality, and built
                  around community—we decided to create it ourselves. Vital Ice was built to bridge
                  the gap between high-performance recovery and everyday accessibility.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.story__text}>
                  This started as a personal need and turned into something bigger: a space where
                  people can reset, recover, and connect. No pressure. No BS. Just cold water, hot
                  air, and the pride that comes with prioritizing your health and wellness.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.story__text}>
                  We built this for the early risers, the post-work plungers, the weekend warriors,
                  and anyone trying to take care of their body and mind in a way that feels real.
                  Whether you&apos;re here to get centered, recover from a hard workout, or just
                  share a moment of peace—we&apos;re glad you&apos;re here.
