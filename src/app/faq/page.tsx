    {
      question: "How do I book a session?",
      answer: "You can book sessions through our Mindbody online portal, by calling us directly, or by visiting our location. We recommend booking in advance, especially for peak hours. Members have priority booking access."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring for my first visit?",
      answer: "Bring comfortable workout clothes, a towel, and a water bottle. We provide towels, but you're welcome to bring your own. Lockers are available for your belongings. Shower facilities are provided."

      question: "Are there any health restrictions?",
      answer: "While our services are generally safe, we recommend consulting with your healthcare provider if you have cardiovascular conditions, are pregnant, or have other health concerns. Our staff can help guide you to appropriate services."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I stay in the cold plunge?",
      answer: "Start with 1-3 minutes and gradually increase your tolerance. Listen to your body and never force yourself to stay longer than comfortable. Our staff can provide guidance based on your experience level."
